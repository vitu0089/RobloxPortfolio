# Who am I?
Hello, my name is Martin Vitus Petersen, also known, most places, as vitu0089.

As I have been coding for a solid 5 years at this point, I thought making a portfolio was due, so I will be trying my best to document a few of my projects. I will of course start with the ones I am most proud of, working my way down.

As I had been working on games of low quality for a while as a freelancer, I wanted to make something a little more serious. Though I haven't finished it yet, I haven't given up on it either. Most code was written in a separate place, then imported when the game started up. This gave me some pretty unique problems like scripts not being present for certain events. This was also the one time I decided to make a large map myself, using Blender and Roblox together, as seen below.
